        <h2>HISTORY OF AIR JORDAN 1</h2><br>
        <p>
            The first Air Jordan was produced for <b>Michael Jordan</b> during his time with the Chicago Bulls in 1984 and designed by Peter C. Moore. 
            The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan I, was later outlawed by then-NBA Commissioner David Stern for having 
            very little white on them (this rule, known as the "51 percent" rule, was repealed in the late 2000s). <br><br>

        <p>
            After the Nike Air Ship was banned, 
            Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan I in colorways with more white, such as the "Chicago" and "Black Toe" colorways. They used the 
            Nike Air Ship's ban as a promotional tool in advertisements, hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage. The Air Jordan I was 
            originally released from 1985 to 1986, with re-releases (known as "retros") in 1994, 2001–2004, and 2007 to the present. Along with the introduction 
            of the Retro Air Jordan line ups, the brand has elevated to a household notoriety with star-struck collaborations and unique limited releases.

            The first Jordan 1 that sneaker fans think of when they think of the Air Jordan 1 is the “Banned” colorway, also known as the “Bred” or Black and Red. 
            They’re called the “Banned” because the story goes that Jordan was fined $5000 per game that he wore them since they broke league uniform rules. 
            It’s true that Jordan wore Black and Red sneakers, and it’s true that NBA commissioner Russ Granik sent Nike a letter about the shoes, but the rest 
            of it is pure legend as far as anyone can tell. The shoes in question were Air Ships, and he wore them only once on October 18, 1984, before the 
            season officially began – the letter was a warning, not a levy of a fine. There’s no confirmation of any subsequent violations, except photos of 
            Jordan wearing the Air Jordan 1s in the same colorway during the 1985 Dunk Contest. There’s no confirmation of any fines.

        <h2>WHY WAS THE JORDAN 1 BANNED FROM NBA GAMES?</h2><br>
        <p>
            On Oct. 18, 1984, Jordan took the court in an exhibition game vs. the Knicks wearing sneakers that were predominantly red and black. This wouldn't seem to be such a foreign concept today, but in 1984, there were certain uniform guidelines that were adhered to. For sneakers specifically, a player had to have shoes that matched those of his teammates and also contain 51 percent white. The red and black sneakers — Jordan later would refer to them as "devil's colors" — caught the eye of NBA commissioner David Stern.
            Because the sneakers broke several rules, NBA executive VP Russ Granik sent a sternly worded letter (get it?) to Nike VP Rob Strasser in February 1985, confirming that Jordan would not be allowed to wear those sneakers on the court.
            However, as with all things Jordan, there's a bit of legend that goes into it. <br><br>
            While a pair of sneakers that Jordan wore were banned from play, it wasn't the Air Jordan 1. In fact, it was the Jordan 1 precursor — the Nike Air Ship — that was banned because of the color scheme "His Airness" wore. Though the sneaker's silhouette was strikingly similar to that of its successor, the Air Ship was a pre-existing model.
            In future years, Jordan and Nike would amend the color scheme to feature more white to fit in with the NBA's rules. Jordan would wear the Air Jordan 1 "Banned" colorway at the 1985 dunk contest, with Nike's "Banned" ad campaign in full swing.
            <br><br>
            The 51-percent rule would stay in place until the late 2000s, when NBA relaxed the color restrictions for its players. In 2018-19, color restrictions for sneakers was completely removed.

        <p>
            During that first season, and that first go around with the sneaker, Nike released 13 colorways of the shoe. 
            The famous “Banned,” “Chicago,” “Royal,” “Black Toe,” “Shadow,” and “Carolina Blue” colorways, as well as Black & White, 
            Blue & White, Metallic Red, Metallic Purple, Metallic Blue, Metallic Green, and Natural Grey. Although dozens of Jordan 1 
            colorways have followed these first 13, those colorways will always stand as the base for what the Air Jordan 1 would grow to become. 
            As weird as it might sound now however, back in 1985, the shoe meant less than the man, and the 1 was no more powerful than the models 
            that would follow them.<br><br>
            Until, of course, Jordan retired.<br><br>
            As quickly as the shoes sold out, Nike restocked them. But they made too many the second time, and they sat on the shelves. And sat. And sat. They sat for years, literally, eventually getting marked down in some places all the way to $20, and many retailers just pulled them off the shelves to marinate in the stockroom, forgotten for a generation. The Jordan 1 was quickly overshadowed by later models, especially the Jordan 3, and effectively forgotten.
            The 1985 flood of Jordan 1s on the market came at the same time that the skateboarding community was looking for something new, and the two communities converged. 
            <br><br>
            With Jordan 1s sitting on shelves for $20, and <b>skaters</b> looking for affordable sneakers that were more robust than the canvas shoes they were wearing, it was a perfect marriage. Although skate culture has done little to drive the success of Air Jordan, the culture has helped to drive sneaker culture writ large: you need look no further than <b>Nike’s SB Dunk</b> program years later (the Dunk, it should be noted, shares a lot of aesthetic similarities to the Jordan 1). This seemingly random pairing would pay off years later when Nike’s Skateboarding program got their hands on the sneaker officially with a Lance Mountain collaboration and others.
